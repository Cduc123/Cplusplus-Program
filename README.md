# Grocery Analyzer

# Project Summary
The Grocery Analyzer is a C++ program that reads grocery item data from a file and allows users to analyze the frequency of items through a menu-driven interface. This tool simplifies grocery data analysis by providing options to check the frequency of specific items, list all item counts, display a histogram of frequencies, and back up data. It addresses the problem of making grocery data more accessible and easy to interact with for users.

# Key Accomplishments
In this project, I structured the class design to make the code organized and straightforward to follow. This structure made it easier to separate functionalities and maintain clarity in the code.

# Areas for Improvement
One area for enhancement is optimizing the `ReadFile()` function, which could be more efficient with larger files. Additionally, adding input validation would make the program more secure and robust by preventing incorrect inputs and handling errors more gracefully.

# Challenges and Solutions
The most challenging part was formatting the histogram display for readability. I overcame this by referring to online resources and documentation to better understand formatting techniques. This process helped improve the visual output of the histogram, making it clearer for users.

# Transferable Skills
Working on this project developed my skills in C++ file input/output and class-based programming, both of which are highly transferable to other coursework and future projects. These skills are essential for handling data in files and organizing code effectively in classes.

# Code Maintainability
To ensure the program is maintainable, I focused on keeping the code readable and adaptable. I organized methods into logical sections, used descriptive variable names, and structured the class for clarity. This approach will make it easier to update, debug, or extend the program in the future.
